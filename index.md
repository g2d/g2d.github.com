I’m Gianluigi Di Donato a Linux SysAdmin developing passionate. I’m 28 years old and I live in Naples, Italy.  This is my personal blog, where i share from my experience about my professional life “the adventures of a Linux SysAdmin ruby passionate”. 
I work every day mainly with Ubuntu/Debian and CentOS/RedHat and sometimes with Gentoo and I’m interested about virtualization, performance cloud and troubleshooting.
