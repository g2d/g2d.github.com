Taking care of your work environment is a priority.
A very well structured environment makes you work better and faster. Usually I’ve been told that a simple text editor is enough but I don’t agree with that because a sysadmin workframe could be much complex.

A sysadmin needs a structured environment.

I am organized as follows:

1) _My bash prompt_
Let’s start from the shell: i love bash, costantemente cerco di migliorare la mia produttività.
As all linux SysAdmin, I daily come from server to server and I have a PS1 line very complex.

I constantly try to improve my own productivity. As like other linux sysadmins, I jump from a server connection to another all day long and this makes my PS1 complex enough.

`[(1.9.2)gdidonato@naples-laptop#Ubuntu dotfiles (master)]$`

this PS1 is ideal as for sysadmin as for ruby developers using git, in fact the shown informations are the following:

ruby version (I use rvm)
current user
current host
Current distribution 
current subdirectory
current branch, if you are in a git repository


2) _My SysAdmin folder_  - I use and love Dropbox, by a simple folder on dropbox, where I store all my configuration tips, my scripts, my notes and my personal pkg. For a long time I used a personal Wiki, but I think that the method doesn’t change anything

3) _git_ no need to discuss… LOL!

4) _virtual_ I use VMware every day, Because all my customers use it. It is so comfortable for me cloning, recycling and moving virtual machines, I have my micro a virtual lab and try the different solutions, experience is a necessity and it is great fun

5) _vim_ is the editor par excellence and it’s also found on busybox. I am not a great expert of vim but the more I learn, the more I love it. We have to use VIM for all configurations from development to the reading log.

6) _Google Docs_ is a great suite, you cannot ask for better. You can share and collaborate with everyone and in all formats. It’s a must have!


And finally: I always use ... "To Do List", my favorite tool is Remember The Milk
