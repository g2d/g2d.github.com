We are always looking for a working method that allows to be more productive, we use many tools such as To-do lists, software, web app, post-it notes, calendar, calendar, etc. _(for me todo list is the best)_, but in the work of the sysadmin this is not enough.

We must gain time every day, and the only way to do it is to automate everything, need to automate at all levels from little scripts for your machine to the production environments . 

For many years I have been opposed to personal customization of shell the dotfiles, I was always wrong about to do it, because how every SysAdmin every day work on dozens of different servers, and for each server there is a story, but I repeat I was wrong about dotfiles, because even a simple shell alias is a first step to automate and improve the quality of work.

Implement a small automation or a small shortcut with the appropriate controls and monitoring allows you to gain time, allows you to experiment, allows the study.

To automate not need to be perfect in most cases some bash scripts can greatly improveyour day. Automate your actions and your actions will speed you earn time.
There are no operations that should be done only once, all are divisible.

Ultimately I have to suggest, automate automates automate and again automate.
